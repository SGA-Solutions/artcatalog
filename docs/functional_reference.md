# **A. Minimalist Museum Style — Full Criteria Guide**

## **1. Visual Atmosphere**

**Goal:** Create the “quiet prestige” of a world-class museum.

* Pure white or slightly warm white backgrounds (`#FFFFFF`, `#F9F9F9`).
* Soft shadows, not harsh. Prefer 2–4% opacity shadows, very diffused.
* No gradients unless extremely subtle.
* Lots of breathing room—double the padding you usually use.
* Use grid layouts similar to museum walls: even spacing, square or portrait-oriented image slots.
* Avoid decorative icons or colors; let the paintings be the color.

## **2. Typography**

**Goal:** Thin, elegant, modern museum text.

* Use **light-weight sans-serif fonts**, such as:

  * Helvetica Neue Light
  * Neue Haas Grotesk
  * Inter 200/300
  * Lato Light
  * Manrope / Space Grotesk (for modern minimalism)
* Font sizes:

  * **H1:** 40–56px thin weight
  * **H2:** 28–36px
  * **Body:** 15–17px regular or light
* Letter spacing: +1% to +3% for elegance.
* No drop shadows, outlines, or textures.

**Tone:** Text should feel quiet—nothing bold unless absolutely necessary.

## **3. Layout + Structure**

**Goal:** Clean, structured, museum-like organization.

* **Large hero section** with one artwork or a wide banner.
* **Plenty of white margins** on left and right (up to 20–30% on desktop).
* Use a **simple header**:

  * Left: Gallery Name (thin text)
  * Right: Minimal navigation (2–4 items only)
* **Module-based layout**, similar to a catalog:

  * Artwork section
  * Artist statement
  * Exhibit theme explanation
  * Close-up gallery or image grid
  * Process photos (optional)
* Avoid carousels unless needed; prefer static grids.

## **4. Presentation of Artworks**

**Goal:** Replicate the feeling of viewing artworks on a gallery wall.

* Display artworks on a **white simulated wall**, with:

  * Light drop shadow (1–2px)
  * Wide margins around each piece
* Use **consistent aspect ratios** in the grid.
* On the artwork detail page:

  * Large centered artwork
  * Title below in thin font
  * Year, medium, size
  * Inspo / narrative / interpretation

**Optional:** Add a small "View in Room" mode (white wall + subtle frame mockup).

## **5. Color Palette**

**Goal:** Quiet prestige, neutral tones.

* White: `#FFFFFF`
* Light Gray: `#F5F5F5`
* Dark Gray for text: `#1A1A1A` or `#2B2B2B`
* Accent (use rarely): muted gold `#C4A86B` or soft beige `#F0EDE6`
* Avoid bright colors for UI elements—they steal focus from artworks.

## **6. Interaction + Motion**

**Goal:** Slow, refined, calm.

* Smooth 200–300ms transitions.
* Slight fade-ins, no bouncy animations.
* Hover effect: mild 1–2% zoom-in or subtle shadow.
* Scrolling should feel like walking through a gallery—linear, not snappy.

## **7. User Experience**

**Goal:** Prestige & immersion.

* No clutter—every element must have a purpose.
* Avoid long paragraphs; keep text concise and airy.
* Paginate long collections instead of showing everything at once.
* Provide a **curator’s note** to give a museum-quality experience.
* Include a **thematic narrative** section explaining the concept behind the exhibit.

## **8. Photography / Artwork Image Standards**

**Goal:** Museum-grade visual fidelity.

* Use high-resolution images (at least 2000px on the longest side).
* Photograph artworks against:

  * Pure white wall
  * Soft diffused natural light
* Avoid shadows that compete with artwork.
* Crop tightly with 5–10% margin.
